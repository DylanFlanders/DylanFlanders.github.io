<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Dylan Flanders and I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at UCLA majoring in computer science. Although I've always been drawn to consumer electronics, I also enjoy a variety of sports and other activities. I've been practicing martial arts for over twelve years, and I was very involved with peer tutoring at my high school. My goal in life is to make a positive impact on the world through the creation and use of high technology.</p>
